# Pokedex web app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was a fun way to learn more about React + Redux and front-end dev by exploring a publically available api https://pokeapi.co/.

You can run this project by cloning and then running npm start in the repo, open http://localhost:3000 to view in your browser.

You can view pokemon in a list with basic information. There is functionality to search for a pokemon directly using the search function at the top of the page (in the future this may be updated to show more information than a general pokemon card).

As well, jumping the index to view pokemon later in the pokedex is supported so the user does not need to click "Next" a lot of times to get to a larger index.
